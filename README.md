# Presentation Webpage

This is a project I created as a curriculum/presentation site. It is constructed using only HTML and CSS, but I look forward to implementing more features in the future.

In the [deprecated/](/deprecated/) directory, there are some HTML files that I considered using but decided against to make the site cleaner.
 
The file structure is a bit different because I wanted the URLs to be clean and not have any file extensions.

## To Do
