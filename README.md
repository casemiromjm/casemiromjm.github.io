# Presentation Webpage

This is a project I created as a curriculum/presentation site. At first I used only HTML and CSS, but I quickly realized I could use Jekyll to make it easier to manage and update the content. I thought about using PHP since I was more familiar with it, but I wanted to use github pages to host it for free, and Jekyll is natively supported there.
